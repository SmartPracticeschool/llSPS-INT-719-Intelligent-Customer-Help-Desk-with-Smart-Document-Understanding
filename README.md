Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

The typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isnâ€™t valid or offer to speak to a real person.
But here in this project by adding an extra feature of smart document understanding aloong with IBM cloud functions we are able to make an intelligent chatbot which can even respond to queries out of scope and also provide information about the product.

This project is implemented by using IBM cloud and it's functions such as Watson Assistant, Watson discovery, Cloud Function and Node-Red. For Watson Discovery the document used is ecobee3_userguide which is configured and then trained.
